# GTM - Server Tag: Facebook TRRKN-Version

## Enhanced Features

Why to choose this template?
We've improved the original Facebook template to offer greater flexibility in implementing Facebook tracking. Here are the key updates:

1. **IP Anonymization**  
   Added an option to anonymize IP addresses for enhanced privacy compliance.

2. **Event Data Mapping**  
   Introduced mapping capabilities for event data names, allowing you to send data without strict adherence to Facebook's naming conventions. This is particularly useful if you aim to avoid duplicating event parameters across platforms.

3. **Control Over Personal Data**  
   Added a feature to **choose** whether personal data, such as email addresses, is sent to Facebook. By default, Facebook would extract such data if found in event parameters.

4. **Automatic Hashed Email Retrieval**  
   Now automatically retrieves hashed email data from Google Ads/Floodlight event parameters, streamlining cross-platform tracking.

These enhancements make the TRRKN-Version of the Facebook tag more adaptable and privacy-conscious, aligning with modern tracking needs.
